Task 1: Setting Up SQL Environment & First Queries

Tools:

Primary: MySQL Community Server + MySQL Workbench

Alternatives: PostgreSQL + pgAdmin, SQLite + DB Browser, SQLFiddle, Google BigQuery

Sandbox

Hints / Mini Guide:

1.Install MySQL Community Server and MySQL Workbench or choose a browser-based SQL

tool to avoid setup delays.

2.Create a new database named intern_training_db to isolate your learning environment.

3.Understand what a database, schema, table, row, and column mean using real-life examples.

4.Create your first table students with columns like id, name, email, and age.

5.Insert at least 5 records using INSERT INTO statements with realistic data.

6.Retrieve all records using SELECT * to verify data insertion.

7.Practice filtering specific columns instead of selecting everything.

8.Execute queries multiple times to understand execution flow and result sets.

Interview Questions Related To Above Task:

What is the difference between a database and a table?

Why should we avoid using SELECT * in production?

What happens if we insert incorrect data types?

What is SQL and where is it used?

Difference between MySQL and PostgreSQL?

Deliverables:

SQL file containing database creation, table creation, insert, and select queries

Final Outcome:

Intern understands SQL environment, syntax structure, and basic data retrieval.




1️⃣ Understanding Core Concepts (with real-life examples)

Database → Like a folder
Example: intern_training_db (contains multiple tables)

Table → Like an Excel sheet inside the folder
Example: students

Column → Like Excel column headers
Example: id, name, email, age

Row → Like a single record / one student’s details

Schema → Logical structure/blueprint of the database
(In MySQL, schema ≈ database)

Below is a complete, beginner-friendly solution to Task 1: Setting Up SQL Environment & First Queries, including explanations, interview answers, and a ready-to-use SQL script.





1️⃣ Understanding Core Concepts (with real-life examples)
Database → Like a folder
Example: intern_training_db (contains multiple tables)

Table → Like an Excel sheet inside the folder
Example: students

Column → Like Excel column headers
Example: id, name, email, age

Row → Like a single record / one student’s details

Schema → Logical structure/blueprint of the database
(In MySQL, schema ≈ database)

2️⃣ SQL Deliverable (Complete SQL File)

-- 1. Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE intern_training_db;

-- 2. Use the database
USE intern_training_db;

-- 3. Create students table
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(150) UNIQUE,
    age INT
);

-- 4. Insert records into students table
INSERT INTO students (name, email, age) VALUES
('Amit Sharma', 'amit.sharma@gmail.com', 21),
('Neha Verma', 'neha.verma@gmail.com', 22),
('Rahul Singh', 'rahul.singh@gmail.com', 20),
('Priya Patel', 'priya.patel@gmail.com', 23),
('Ankit Kumar', 'ankit.kumar@gmail.com', 21);

-- 5. Retrieve all records
SELECT * FROM students;

-- 6. Retrieve specific columns only
SELECT name, email FROM students;

-- 7. Filter records using condition
SELECT name, age
FROM students
WHERE age > 21;




3️⃣ Key Learning Points from Queries

CREATE DATABASE → Creates isolated learning environment

AUTO_INCREMENT → Automatically generates unique IDs

PRIMARY KEY → Uniquely identifies each row

INSERT INTO → Adds data into table

SELECT → Retrieves data

WHERE → Filters rows

Avoid repeating SELECT * unnecessarily
