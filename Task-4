Task 4: Sorting and Limiting Data (MySQL)


1.Sorting Data with ORDER BY
Basic sorting
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY name;

Sorts records by name in ascending order (default).

Descending order
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY name DESC;
Sorting by multiple columns
SELECT * FROM students
ORDER BY department ASC, marks DESC;

First sorts by department, then by highest marks within each department.


2. Limiting Rows with LIMIT
Get first N records
SELECT * FROM students
LIMIT 5;

Returns only 5 rows.

Pagination using LIMIT with OFFSET
SELECT * FROM students
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5;

Skips first 5 rows, shows next 5.

Alternate (common MySQL syntax):

SELECT * FROM students
LIMIT 5, 5;

 LIMIT offset, count


3. Sorting + Limiting Together (Very Common)
Top 3 highest scorers
SELECT name, marks
FROM students
ORDER BY marks DESC
LIMIT 3;
Latest 10 records by date
SELECT *
FROM students
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;


4. Sorting with Conditions
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE department = 'Computer Science'
ORDER BY marks DESC
LIMIT 5;

Top 5 CS students by marks.
