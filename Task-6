CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    age INT,
    course VARCHAR(50),
    enrollment_date DATE
);

1.  CREATE – Insert Data

 Insert a single record
INSERT INTO students (name, email, age, course, enrollment_date)
VALUES ('Amit Sharma', 'amit@gmail.com', 21, 'SQL', '2026-01-15');

Insert multiple records
INSERT INTO students (name, email, age, course, enrollment_date)
VALUES
('Neha Verma', 'neha@gmail.com', 22, 'Python', '2026-01-16'),
('Rahul Mehta', 'rahul@gmail.com', 23, 'Java', '2026-01-17');


2. READ – Retrieve Data

View all records
SELECT * FROM students;

 Select specific columns
SELECT name, course FROM students;

 Filter data
SELECT * FROM students WHERE course = 'SQL';

Combine conditions
SELECT * FROM students
WHERE age > 21 AND course = 'Python';

 Sort results
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY enrollment_date DESC;


3.UPDATE – Modify Existing Data
➤ Update one record
UPDATE students
SET age = 22
WHERE student_id = 1;

UPDATE students
SET course = 'Advanced SQL', age = 23
WHERE email = 'amit@gmail.com';


4. DELETE – Remove Data

Delete a specific record
DELETE FROM students
WHERE student_id = 3;

Delete using condition
DELETE FROM students
WHERE course = 'Java';

 Delete all records (table stays)
DELETE FROM students;
DELETE ≠ DROP



SELECT * FROM students WHERE student_id = 3;
If the result looks right → then run UPDATE or DELETE.
