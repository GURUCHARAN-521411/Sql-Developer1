Task 5: Aggregate Functions & GROUP BY
Objective
Learn how to summarize data using aggregate functions and organize results using GROUP BY.

Common Aggregate Functions
Function	Purpose
COUNT()	Counts rows
SUM()	Adds values
AVG()	Calculates average
MIN()	Finds minimum
MAX()	Finds maximum
Sample Table
Assume this table exists:

students


1. Count total students

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_students
FROM students;

2. Find average marks of all students
SELECT AVG(marks) AS average_marks
FROM students;

3. Find highest and lowest marks
SELECT 
    MAX(marks) AS highest_marks,
    MIN(marks) AS lowest_marks
FROM students;

4. Count students per course (GROUP BY)
SELECT course, COUNT(*) AS student_count
FROM students
GROUP BY course;

5. Average marks per course
SELECT course, AVG(marks) AS avg_marks
FROM students
GROUP BY course;

6. Total marks per course
SELECT course, SUM(marks) AS total_marks
FROM students
GROUP BY course;

7. Filter grouped results using HAVING
Find courses with average marks greater than 80

SELECT course, AVG(marks) AS avg_marks
FROM students
GROUP BY course
HAVING AVG(marks) > 80;
